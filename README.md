# help-homeless
Help homeless/beggars app is a platform which connects the people who needs help and people who can provide them.

Here are the action items which we need to volunteers to work on.
1. User sign-in page [get user-info and pass it to the backend]. We can use third party sign-in as facebook and google login-APIs 
- [ Login as Giver]
- [ Login as Homeless] 
- [ Login as volunteer] 
2. Home page shows near by spots which can help us to locate givers and items which they provide[like food, clothes, shelter, etc]
3. Volunteer's collect the food and deliver to the nearby homeless centre.
4. Homeless login page will help the to find food, clothes or even homeless centre. 
5. Emergency toll-free number which they can reach.
